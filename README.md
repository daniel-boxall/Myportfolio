This website was coded in VSCode with knowledge obtained from CS50x and freecodecamp.org combined the pages within this website are:

- Homepage: This is just a welcome page with nice background. 
- About page: This page just contains basic info of how i started coding.
- Projects page: This page contains screen shot of projects with button that links to the project.
- Contact page: This is just a contact form that collects data using netlfy forms.

The navbar and project cards where coded with the help of tutorials on Youtube created by CSS expert [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob). They are fully responsive based on screen size.

## Deployment
The website is deployed using netlify, with direct build from github repo, so every time i update the repo my website automatically rebuilds using the updated files from repo.
The contact form data is collected by netlify forms and held in the file until i download them. This will be automated in the future using when i build an api once built Netlify funtions will push the data to the hosted api then the data will be fetched by connected Android app. This function has not been built and implemented yet as i have not acquired the knowledge to do so but this is on my to do list.
